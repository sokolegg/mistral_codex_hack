This can lead to confusion about who the Agreement refers to at any given point.\n\n2. **Undefined Terms:**\n   - The term \"proprietary information\" was used without defining what it includes. This can lead to ambiguity and potential disputes about what information is considered confidential.\n\n3. **The Meaning Changes as the Text Progresses:**\n   - The term \"party\" was initially used to refer to both the Employer and the Employee collectively. Later, it was used to refer to either the Employer or the Employee individually, leading to a shift in meaning.\n\n**How Students Can Fix It:**\n\n1. **Using Different Terms for the Same Concept:**\n   - Ensure consistent terminology throughout the document. For example, consistently use \"Party\" to refer to both the Employer and the Employee, and specify that \"Party\" and \"Parties\" are interchangeable.\n\n2. **Undefined Terms:**\n   - Define key terms at the beginning of the document or in a dedicated section. For example, provide a clear definition of \"proprietary information\" to avoid ambiguity.\n\n3. **The Meaning Changes as the Text Progresses:**\n   - Maintain consistent usage of terms to avoid shifts in meaning. For example, always use \"Party\" to refer to both the Employer and the Employee collectively, and specify when referring to either individually."

The correct phrasing should specify clear criteria or conditions for determining the bonus rather than leaving it entirely up to the Employer's discretion, which could lead to ambiguity and potential disputes."

For example, \"The Employer may terminate this Agreement immediately upon the occurrence of any breach of this Agreement by the Employee, including but not limited to gross misconduct, negligence, or violation of company policies.\" The use of \"it\" and \"they\" should be avoided to maintain clarity.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Terminology:**\n   - The term \"Employee\" is used consistently throughout the document, but the term \"Employer\" is sometimes referred to as \"the company\" or \"TechSolutions Inc.\" This inconsistency can cause confusion.\n\n3. **Lack of Consistency in Formatting:**\n   - The document lacks consistent font sizes, spacing, or indentation. For example, the headers and sub-headers are not formatted consistently, and the spacing between sections varies.\n\n4. **Disorganized Layout:**\n   - The document fails to use headers, numbered clauses, or bullet points consistently for readability and logical flow. For example, the \"DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES\" section is numbered, but other sections are not.\n\n5. **Dates Related to One Entity Must Match:**\n   - The document specifies the \"Effective Date\" as November 1, 2023, but it is not consistently referenced throughout the contract.\n\n6. **Switching between Active and Passive Voice Inconsistently:**\n   - The document switches between active and passive voice inconsistently. For example, \"The Employer agrees to pay the Employee\" is in active voice, while \"Any additional compensation...shall be determined by the Employer\" is in passive voice.\n\n7. **Incorrect Citations:**\n   - The document fails to cite relevant laws, statutes, or precedents correctly. For example, the \"GOVERNING LAW\" section does not specify the exact statutes or laws that govern the agreement.\n\n8. **Ambiguous Language:**\n   - The document contains ambiguous language. For example, \"The Employee shall not disclose any confidential information to any third party without the prior written consent of the Employer\" is vague and does not specify what constitutes confidential information.\n\n9. **The Meaning Changes as the Text Progresses:**\n   - The meaning of certain terms and responsibilities changes as the text progresses. For example, the duties of the Employee are initially specific, but later responsibilities such as \"Perform other duties as assigned by the Employer\" are too broad and vague."

For example, \"It is to be paid before the first day of every month\" could refer to either the rent or another payment.\n\n3. **Lack of Consistency in Formatting**:\n   - Inconsistent font sizes, spacing, or indentation detracts from professionalism and readability. For example, the headings and subheadings are not consistently formatted.\n\n4. **Inaccurate wording in the text**:\n   - The phrase \"Hereby, both parties agree\" is awkward and should be rephrased for clarity.\n\n5. **Ambiguous Language**:\n   - The term \"reasonable timeframe\" is not defined, leaving room for interpretation and potential disputes.\n\n6. **Incorrect Citations**:\n   - Failing to cite relevant laws, statutes, or precedents correctly.

The document lacks a clear structure with numbered sections.\n\n8. **Switching between active and passive voice inconsistently**:\n   - The document switches between active and passive voice, which can be confusing. For example, \"The Sublessor agrees to notify\" is active, while \"The monthly rent to be paid is $1,200\" is passive.\n\n9. **Undefined Terms**:\n   - Failing to define legal or technical jargon, especially terms specific to the case. The term \"original lease\" is not defined or explained in the context of this agreement."

In some places, it is capitalized, and in others, it is not. This inconsistency can lead to confusion about what exactly constitutes the services being provided.\n\n3. **Disorganized Layout**: The document lacks clear headers, numbered clauses, or bullet points for readability and logical flow. For example, the \"TERM OF AGREEMENT\" section is not clearly separated from the \"INVOICES\" section, and there is no use of bullet points or numbered lists to enhance readability.\n\n4. **Misuse of Pronouns**: The document overuses pronouns like 'it,' 'they,' or 'he/she,' leading to confusion about which party or entity is being referred to. For example, in the \"TERM OF AGREEMENT\" section, the use of 'this Agreement' and 'either party' can be confusing without clear antecedents.\n\n5. **Inaccurate Wording**: The document contains inaccurate wording that can lead to misunderstandings. For example, in the \"LIABILITY\" section, the phrase \"except as expressly provided in this Agreement\" is vague and does not specify what exceptions are being referred to.\n\n6. **Lack of Clarity**: The document uses vague or unclear terms that lead to multiple interpretations. For example, the phrase \"reasonable time\" is used without defining what constitutes a reasonable time, which can lead to disputes between the parties."

For example, \"The Parties agree that the loan information set below is accurate.\" Here, 'it' and 'they' are used vaguely.\n\n2. **Disorganized Layout:**\n   - The document lacks headers, numbered clauses, or bullet points for readability and logical flow. The sections are not clearly demarcated, and the information is not presented in a structured manner.\n\n3. **Lack of Clarity:**\n   - The document uses vague or unclear terms that lead to multiple interpretations, such as \"reasonable time\" without defining it. This term is used in the 'Default' section without specifying what constitutes a 'reasonable time.'\n\n4. **The Meaning Changes as the Text Progresses:**\n   - The document's meaning shifts as it progresses. For example, the 'Default' section initially states that a late fee will be charged, but then it mentions a 'reasonable time' for the Borrower to cure the default, which is not specified.\n\n5. **Lack of Consistency in Formatting:**\n   - The document has inconsistent font sizes, spacing, or indentation, which detracts from professionalism and readability. The spacing and indentation are not consistent throughout the document.\n\n6. **Inaccurate Wording in the Text:**\n   - The wording in the document is inaccurate. For example, the 'Default' section states that the Lender 'may' charge a late fee, which is not a definitive statement.\n\n7. **Broken Cross-References:**\n   - The document contains broken cross-references. For example, the 'Repayment Schedule' section refers to a repayment schedule that will be provided, but it does not specify where or how this schedule will be provided.\n\n8. **Switching between Active and Passive Voice Inconsistently:**\n   - The document switches between active and passive voice inconsistently. For example, \"The Parties agree to insert their basic information down below:\" is in passive voice, while \"The Borrower agrees to make monthly payments starting on the Start Date of the First Payment\" is in active voice."
